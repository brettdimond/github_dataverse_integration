# Nothing to see here

This is just a test git repository to test Github actions integration with Dataverse using the [Dataverse Uploader](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dataverse-uploader-action) action.

Note that for geojson files, unless using a newer version of Dataverse, mimetypes won't be set correctly as they're not supported by the uploader. This would have to be addressed in either [Dataverse Uploader](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-uploader) and or [pyDataverse](https://github.com/gdcc/pyDataverse). Or, more likely, the action would need to be replaced with another that uses [dataverse_utils](https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/dataverse_utils) instead.

Anyway. . .
